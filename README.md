A collection of implementations of prominent algorithms and data strucutres by U-students @ LiU

## Implementation suggestions
The following lists are some suggestions for algorithms and data structures which
has not yet been implemented or only implemented in a very limited fashion.
You can of cource pick any algorithm/data structure you want!

Algorithms:

- [] AC-3
- [] Hill Climbing (normal and enforced)
- [] A*
- [] DFS
- [] BFS
- [] Quicksort
- [] Mergesort
- [] Heapsort
- [] Insertion sort
- [] 2opt
- [] Alpha-Beta pruning
- [] Minimax

Data structures
- [] Search trees
- [] Balanced trees (AVL, Splay and Red-Black)
- [] Persistant rope
- [] Priority Queue (min or max heap)
- [] Prefix tree
