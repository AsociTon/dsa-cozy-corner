# Rust implementation

Make sure that you have both Rust, Cargo and Rustfmt installed before proceeding

## Running tests

To run all the tests you simply run the following command:

```
cargo test
```

## Formatting code

Before submitting new implementations or making changes to existing implementations please make sure to
format the source code accoring to Rusts standards.
This can be done easily by running:

```
cargo fmt
```

which will format all the source recursivly downwards.
