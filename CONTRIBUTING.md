# Contributing to the Cozy-Corner
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just guidelines, not rules so please use your best judgement.
Feel free to propose changes to this by creating an issue or better yet, a pull request.
Any language is welcome and implementing the same algorithm in multiple languages is encouraged!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
- All commits should be in English
- Use the present tense ("Add implementation..." not "Added implementation..")
- Use the imperative modd ("Move element to ..." not "Moves element to ...")
- Keep it short and sweet. If you need "and" then it should probably be multiple commits

Read on general best practises at http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

### Code Styleguide
- Have well commented code. All public methods/functions should have decent comments
- Please include unit tests so that the correctness of the implementation can be validated
- Use "Hanging brackets"
- Use 2 spaces and not tabs (unless language specifies otherwise)
